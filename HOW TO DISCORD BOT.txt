How to Create and Set Up Your Tenosai-Bot on Discord

1. Create a Discord Account:
   If you don't already have one, go to https://discord.com and create an account.

2. Access the Discord Developer Portal:
   - Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications
   - Log in with your Discord account.

3. Create a New Application:
   - Click on the "New Application" button (usually in the top right).
   - Give your application a name (e.g., "Tenosai-Bot" or your bot's desired name).
   - Agree to Discord's Terms of Service if prompted.
   - Click "Create".

4. Navigate to the "Bot" Tab:
   - Once your application is created, you'll be taken to its settings page.
   - On the left sidebar, click on "Bot".

5. Create a Bot User:
   - Click the "Add Bot" button.
   - A confirmation pop-up will appear; click "Yes, do it!".

6. Configure Your Bot User:
   - **Get Your Bot Token:**
     - Under the "TOKEN" section (you might see "View Token" or "Reset Token"), click "Reset Token".
     - Confirm by clicking "Yes, do it!".
     - **COPY THE TOKEN IMMEDIATELY.** This is your bot's secret key. You will need this for the Tenosai-Bot configurator.
     - **Treat this token like a password. Keep it secret and safe! Do not share it.**
   - **Enable Privileged Gateway Intents:**
     - Scroll down to the "Privileged Gateway Intents" section.
     - Enable the following three intents:
       * **Presence Intent**
       * **Server Members Intent**
       * **Message Content Intent**
     - Make sure to click "Save Changes" at the bottom of the page if it appears.

7. Set Up Bot Permissions (OAuth2 URL Generator):
   - On the left sidebar, click on "OAuth2", then select "URL Generator" from the submenu.
   - **Scopes:** In the "SCOPES" section, check the box next to "bot".
   - **Bot Permissions:** A new "BOT PERMISSIONS" section will appear below. Select the following permissions:
     * Read Messages/View Channels
     * Send Messages
     * Send Messages in Threads (recommended)
     * Manage Messages (for deleting bot's own messages or admin-deleting others)
     * Embed Links
     * Attach Files
     * Read Message History
     * Add Reactions (for features like üóëÔ∏è quick delete)
     * Use Application Commands (absolutely necessary for slash commands like `/gen`)

8. Generate the Invite Link:
   - After selecting the scopes and permissions, a "GENERATED URL" will appear at the bottom of the page.
   - Click "Copy" to copy this URL.

9. Invite the Bot to Your Server:
   - Open a new tab in your web browser and paste the copied invite URL.
   - Select the Discord server you want to add the bot to from the dropdown menu.
   - Click "Continue" or "Authorize".
   - Review the permissions you are granting and click "Authorize".
   - Complete the CAPTCHA if prompted.
   - The bot should now appear in your server's member list (it will be offline until you run the Python script).

10. Configure Your Tenosai-Bot:
    - Run the Tenosai-Bot configurator (`TENOSAI-BOT.bat` or `python config-editor-script.py`).
    - Go to the "Main Config" tab.
    - In the `BOT_API` section, paste your copied bot token into the `KEY` field.
    - In the `ADMIN` section, enter your Discord username (e.g., `yourusername` - without the #numbers) into the `USERNAME` field.
    - Configure all other necessary paths for "Outputs", "Models", "CLIP", "LoRAs", and "Custom Nodes".
    - Click "Save Main Config".
    - Review settings in other tabs (Bot Settings, LoRA Styles, Favorites, LLM Prompts) and save them as needed.

11. Start Your Tenosai-Bot:
    - In the Tenosai-Bot configurator, go to the "Bot Control" tab.
    - Click the "Start Bot" button.
    - Check the log output in the configurator and your command prompt/terminal for any errors.

**Important Reminders:**
- **Keep your bot token secret.** Never share it publicly or commit it to version control systems (like GitHub).
- If you suspect your token has been compromised, go back to the Discord Developer Portal ("Bot" tab for your application) and reset it immediately, then update it in the Tenosai-Bot configurator.

Enjoy using your Tenosai-Bot!
